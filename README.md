# Pokemon-Quiz
A GUI "Who's That Pokemon" quiz made in Java

A JFrame holds images, labels, radio buttons, a progress bar, and a button to quiz users on which Pokemon is shown.\
The filenames for the images, the radio button label text, and correct answers for each question are stored in arrays.\
A rng is used to select a random index in the arrays to randomize the order of the test questions.\
Methods are implemented to replace the array with an array of one fewer element, removing the index of the asked question.\
A progress bar fills as answers are submitted, and at the end, a score is displayed.
